Jigyaasa received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. Some praised the movie for its bold and realistic portrayal of the dark side of Bollywood, while others criticized it for being vulgar and sensational. The movie was also compared to other films that explored the theme of ambition and fame, such as Aashiq Banaya Aapne, Page 3, and Corporate. Some critics also noted the similarities between Jigyaasa and Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless, which featured a female protagonist who wanted to be a movie star.
  
The movie also sparked some controversies for its explicit scenes and dialogues. The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) cut about ten minutes of S&M scenes that were deemed too hard for the Indian market, but passed the film uncut for the international market. The movie also faced some legal troubles when a producer named Raju Chand claimed that he had the rights to the title Jigyaasa and filed a case against the makers of the film. However, the case was dismissed by the court.
  
Jigyaasa was not a commercial success at the box office, but it gained some cult following over the years. The movie was also unofficially remade in Marathi in 2014 as Nati, which means Actress. However, some scenes and dramatization were changed to avoid any legal hassles. Jigyaasa remains one of the most controversial and talked-about movies in Indian cinema history.
